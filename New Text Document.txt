App.js => where eventually all our components will meet
App.css => where there will be the css for our application
index.js => this is where all our application is going to live, we'll render our app in the index.js
            index.js is a Javascript entry point so we'll have to add some additional code

// start react adventure

1. Create our first component
  In order to do that we'll need only 2 things, import React from react dependency,
  a function which will be the component where the name of the func will start w a capital letter
  so that react knows that this is not some regular func its one of the component.
  And then from the component, were returning HTML, which officially is called JSX

2. Inject your Javascript into the index.html by importing ReactDom and then we have render() func
   and in that func we pass in 2 things- a) whatever we're going to render b) where we're going to render

import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";

function Greeting() {
  // func name is Capital so that way react will know this is special
  return <h4>this is rohit & this is my first component</h4>;
}

ReactDom.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById("root"));
