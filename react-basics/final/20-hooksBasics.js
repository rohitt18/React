// why hooks?
// If all we have is a component with some static data or a component with a list, life is great
// but once we want to make our components dynamic & more complex, and ofc as a result, also our app
// we will need to use react hooks, which are functions react provides to help us complete various tasks.
// for eg- adding or removing the items from the list, toggling the model & fetching the data, just to name a few
// There are quite a few hooks out there, but I can honestly say that if you understand only 2 of them, useState & useEffect
// you'll be already in a good shape.

// thats why we'll learn useState n useEffect first & code some examples and we'll keep on using them.

// firstly , It  is necessary to use 'useState' hook as our applications gets bigger & more complicated
